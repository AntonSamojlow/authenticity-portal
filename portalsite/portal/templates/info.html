<h1>About this portal</h1>
<p>This is a prototype of a web site/server that</p>
<ul>
    <li>serves selected <span style="color:royalblue" data-bs-placement="top"
            title="note that in my terminology, prediction models include classification">prediction models</span>
        to a general audience</li>
    <li>presents the models within a specific topic (use case), providing additional information and context</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage description</h3>
<p>
    The portal is designed to accomodate two different work flows (and user types):
</p>
<p>
    The <b>general user</b> uses validated models to obtain information about their dataset, in particular:
<ul>
    <li>a quantitative prediction, like the nutrient content of a sample</li>
    <li>a classification, like the authenticity of a sample (likelihood of class member ship)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    This user typically interactes by accessing a specific topic section,
    over the <a href="{% url 'index' %}">entry page (home)</a> or by directly accessing the relevant topic,
    like the <a href="{% url 'topic' topic='iris' %}">iris section</a>. Here, selected models are listed and available 
    to use for a prediction via the 'Use for a prediction button' in the 'Actions' column. This leads to a form
    where the user may submit his dataset.
</p>

</p>
<p>
    The <b>data manager</b> or scientist curates the validated models. This involves
<ul>
    <li>upload of new measurment data: see <a href="{% url 'measurements' %}">measurement overview</a></li>
    <li>generation of new models: see <a href="{% url 'models' %}">model overview</a></li>
    <li>training of models: select a specific model from the model overview and choose from compativle
        measruements to train on
    </li>
    <li>declaring a model as valid for use by general users: having a specific model select sel√¶ected
        its <i>'Ready for predictions'</i> status can be changed</li>
</ul>
<p>
    This user typically has advanced access to the site and also operates in the data overview sections
    for all <a href="{% url 'models' %}">models</a> and <a href="{% url 'measurements' %}">measurements</a>. 
    In contrast, the topic pages only present a subset, since models and measurements each have a group tag 
    used to filter (the iris section for example shows only objects belonging to 
    at least one group with 'iris' in its name ).

    Moreover, selected users have staff privileges, which enable have full control over data tables behind 
    this site via djangos <a href="{% url 'admin:index' %}">Admin</a> portal.
