    <h1>About this portal</h1>
    <p>This is a prototype of a web site/server that</p>
    <ul>
        <li>serves selected <span style="color:royalblue" data-bs-placement="top"
                title="note that in my terminology, prediction models include classification">prediction models</span>
            to a general audience</li>
        <li>presents the models within a specific topic (use case), providing additional information and context</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It is named <i>authenticity-portal</i> to indicate one possible field of application: 
        A platform where one can upload some (measurement) data of a food to verify/predict 
        certain properties, like authenticity of the geographical organic. The prediction models 
        are curated and validated by trusted institutions. 
    </p>

    <p>
        You are welcome to use one of two pre-made users accounts to explore the functionality of this site:
    <ul>
        <li>user 'generic_test_user', password 'GENER1C!', with only basic rights </li>
        <li>user 'scientist_test_user', password 'SC1ENCE!', with rights to all portals and the and
            selected administration privileges</li>
    </ul>
    </p>


    <h3>Usage description</h3>
    <p>
        The portal is designed to accomodate two different work flows (and user types):
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>General users</b>can obtain information about their dataset from validated models, in particular:
    <ul>
        <li>a quantitative prediction, like the nutrient content of a sample</li>
        <li>a classification, like the authenticity of a sample (likelihood of class member ship)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This user typically interactes by accessing a specific topic section,
        over the <a href="{% url 'index' %}">entry page (home)</a> or by directly accessing the relevant topic,
        like the <a href="{% url 'topic' topic='iris' %}">iris section</a>. Here, selected models are listed and
        available
        to use for a prediction via the 'Use for a prediction button' in the 'Actions' column. This leads to a form
        where the user may submit his dataset.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        The data manager or <b>scientist</b> curates the available validated models. This involves
    <ul>
        <li>upload of new measurment data: see <a href="{% url 'measurements' %}">measurement overview</a></li>
        <li>generation of new models: see <a href="{% url 'models' %}">model overview</a></li>
        <li>training of models: select a specific model from the model overview and choose from compativle
            measruements to train on
        </li>
        <li>declaring a model as valid for use by general users: having a specific model select sel√¶ected
            its <i>'Ready for predictions'</i> status can be changed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This user typically has advanced access to the site and also operates in the data overview sections
        for all <a href="{% url 'models' %}">models</a> and <a href="{% url 'measurements' %}">measurements</a>.
        In contrast, the topic pages only present a subset, since models and measurements each have a group tag
        used to filter (the iris section for example shows only objects belonging to
        at least one group with 'iris' in its name ).

        Moreover, selected users have staff privileges, which enable have full control over data tables behind
        this site via djangos <a href="{% url 'admin:index' %}">Admin</a> portal.
    </p>

    <h3>Topics</h3>
    <p>
        Three topics are presented: Iris, Salmon and Vanilla. The first is built around the common iris set. The other
        two are (currently) just dummy pages. Maybe you can fill them with meaningful data and models ;) ?
    </p>

    <h3>Models</h3>
    <p>
        Currently, two model types are implemented: <b>Linear regression</b> as a simple example of a model capable of
        <i>quantitative</i> predictions. And <b>SIMCA</b> as an example of a classification model (predicting the
        likelihood of class memebership). The latter may not be well-known in all fields - it was ported by me to python
        from the <a href="https://mdatools.com/docs/simca.html">R package 'mdatools'</a>
        for use in this portal, see also <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/cem.2506">this reference</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        More model types can be easily added in python.
        For other languages, additional work (or a different platform than heroku) might be required.
